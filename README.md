# YouTube Adview Prediction

## Overview
YouTube Adview Prediction is a machine learning project designed to predict the number of ad views a YouTube video is likely to generate. This project leverages regression models to analyze video attributes and estimate ad view counts, enabling creators and advertisers to optimize their strategies.

## Features
1. **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of YouTube video data to identify trends and patterns.
2. **Prediction Models**: Implementation of regression models to predict ad views.
3. **Visualization**: Interactive plots and graphs for data insights.
4. **User-Friendly Interface**: Seamless interaction for data upload and prediction.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
- Video Title
- Published Date
- Category
- Likes
- Dislikes
- Comments
- Shares
- Subscribers
- Ad Clicks

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/youtube-adview-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd youtube-adview-prediction
   ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset into the notebook.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.
3. Train and test different regression models.
4. Use the trained model to predict ad views for new videos.
